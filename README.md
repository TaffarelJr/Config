# Config

Machine configuration and setup.

Configuration files for common applications are stored in the [apps](./apps) folder.

PowerShell scripts for automatically installing & configuring various applications are stored in the [scripts](./scripts) folder.

- Just about all scripts require PowerShell to be launched with Administrator privileges.
- Running the [NewMachine](./scripts/_NewMachine.ps1) script will run all the other scripts in turn, effectively configuring a blank machine with everything it needs.
